## OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

### Project: Text Classification Using NLP

### Objective
The objective of a project on text classification of spam using Natural Language Processing (NLP) typically revolves around identifying and filtering out spam messages from legitimate ones in textual data 

        
### Key Activities

   -**Data Gathering**: Collect a diverse dataset of text messages that includes both spam (undesirable messages) and ham (legitimate messages)
   
   -**Feature Extraction**: Extract relevant features from the text data that can help distinguish between spam and ham messages
   
   -**Bag-of-Words (BoW)**: Represent each message as a vector of word frequencies.

   -**Cross-Validation**: Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness and avoid overfitting.

### Technologies Used

-**NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: A suite of libraries and programs for symbolic and statistical natural language processing.

-**Transformers (Hugging Face): Framework for state-of-the-art models like BERT, GPT, and others, offering pre-trained models and easy integration.

-**Python**: Programming language commonly used for machine learning tasks.

-**TensorFlow / Keras**: For building and training neural network models, including deep learning models for NLP tasks.

-**TF-IDF Vectorizers**: Provided by libraries like scikit-learn, used to convert text data into numerical feature vectors.

### Key Insights

-**Data Exploration**: The choice and effectiveness of features extracted from text data significantly impact the performance of the spam classification model.

-**Role of Data Quality and Quantity**:The quality and quantity of training data directly influence the model's ability to generalize and accurately classify new messages.

-**Importance of Model Interpretability:**: Interpretability of the classification model is crucial for understanding why certain messages are classified as spam or legitimate.

-**ROC Curve and AUC**: Relevant for binary classification tasks, provide insight into the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate.
